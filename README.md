# 📊 Sales Forecasting & Anomaly Detection (using Power BI)

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
A retail organization required a shift from looking at what *happened* to what *will happen*. As an **BI Analyst**, I built a comprehensive Power BI solution to:
- **Forecast** future sales trends using built-in AI models.
- **Detect** anomalies (unusual spikes/dips) that manual analysis would miss.

## 📊 Key Features & Analysis

### 🔍 Historical Analysis & Seasonality
* **Line Chart Trends:** Analyzed historical sales data to visualize long-term growth.
* **Seasonality Identification:** Used Power BI to pinpoint recurring annual sales cycles, specifically identifying peak performance periods in [Year/Month].

### 🔮 AI Forecasting
* **Predictive Modeling:** Utilized the **Analytics Pane** to generate a sales forecast with a **95% confidence interval**.
* **Accuracy:** Adjusted seasonality settings within the tool to ensure the forecast accounted for holiday surges and business cycles.

### ⚠️ Anomaly Detection
* **Automated Outliers:** Enabled **Anomaly Detection** to flag data points that fall outside the expected range.
* **Explanation:** Used AI to "Explain the Anomaly," identifying which specific segments (e.g., Order date or Sales) contributed most to the deviation.

### 📝 Smart Narratives
* **Dynamic Summaries:** Implemented **Smart Narratives** to translate complex charts into a natural language summary.
* This visual automatically updates based on filters, providing management with "at-a-glance" insights.

## 💡 Business Insights & Actions
* **Compare Actual vs. Forecast:** Created DAX measures to track variance between predicted and real-world sales.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Anomalies detected on specific dates helped identify potential data entry errors or supply chain disruptions.
* **Growth Opportunity:** Identified high-performing seasonal trends that management can leverage for targeted marketing campaigns.
